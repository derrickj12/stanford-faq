# Frequently Asked Questions

- **What is the difference between score and performance of my Bot?**

The score is computed when the true value is revealed and compared to your prediction: a low score is better, exactly like golf! Performance is a weighted average of your scores so we look at an aggregate of your scores to reflect your overall Bot quality.
